            <h1>What is Expressionism?</h1>
            <p>
                Expressionism emerged simultaneously in various cities across Germany as a response to a
                widespread anxiety about humanity's increasingly discordant relationship with the
                world and accompanying lost feelings of authenticity and spirituality.

            <h1>Key Ideas</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The arrival of Expressionism announced new standards in the creation and judgment of art. Art was
                    now
                    meant to come forth from within the artist, rather than from a depiction of the external visual
                    world,
                    and the standard for assessing the quality of a work of art became the character of the artist's
                    feelings rather than an analysis of the composition.</li>
                <li>
                    Expressionist artists often employed swirling, swaying, and exaggeratedly executed brushstrokes in
                    the
                    depiction of their subjects. These techniques were meant to convey the turgid emotional state of
                    the
                    artist reacting to the anxieties of the modern world.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Through their confrontation with the urban world of the early-20th century, Expressionist artists
                    developed a powerful mode of social criticism in their serpentine figural renderings and bold
                    colors.
                    Their representations of the modern city included alienated individuals - a psychological
                    by-product of
                    recent urbanization - as well as prostitutes, who were used to comment on capitalism's role in the
                    emotional distancing of individuals within cities.
